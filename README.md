# LoxScanner & Parser
A three part assignment in the course Programming Languages at Umeå University. 
The first assignment; an introduction to Haskell and the first step to a Complier for the Lox-language introduced in the book Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom. 
The second assignment: the second step to a Compiler for the Lox-language, a Parser to parse tokens given from scanner to a syntax tree representing the program.
The third and last step: a interpreter to interpret and run the Lox-language, using the syntax Tree.
